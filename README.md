# BurstBalancer


## Introduction

Layer-3 load balancing is a key topic in the networking field. It is well acknowledged that flowlet is the most promising solution because of its good trade-off between load balance and packet reordering. However, we find its another limitation: it makes the forwarding paths of flows unpredictable. To address this limitation, this paper presents BurstBalancer, a simple yet efficient load balancing system with a sketch, named BalanceSketch. Our design philosophy is doing less changes to keep the forwarding path of most flows fixed, which guides the design of BalanceSketch and balance operations. We have fully implemented BurstBalancer in a testbed and conducted both event-level and ESL (electronic system level) simulations. Our results show that BurstBalancer achieves 5%âˆ¼35% and up to $30\times$ smaller FCT in symmetric and asymmetric topologies, respectively, while 58 times less flows suffer from path changing.
